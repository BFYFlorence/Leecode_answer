# Leecode_answer

I know its full name is "Leetcode", but don't you think "Leecode" is much easier to pronounce?

Anyway, this project records the answers of exercises on [Leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/problemset/all/). The codings of answers are all done by myself, including Binary tree, heap, queue, hash, dynamic programming and other data structures and algorithms. In this way, I'm trying to keep my mind sharp.
